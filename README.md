# Sparrow Character Editor

A simple **WIP** tool to adjust character animations and offsets from Sparrow V2 spritesheets.

Once released, will feature exporting character data to:
  - Psych Engine Character JSONs
  - Custom JSON format
  - Maybe creating a copy-pastable block of code for you to copy paste into your game?
